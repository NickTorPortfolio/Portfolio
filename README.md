<h1>Introduction</h1>
Welcome to the Numerical Analyzer App! It is an Python web application for analyzing and classifying positive integer numbers. In order to launch, it run "app.py". On application home page, enter any positive integer in the form provided on the home page and receive the numerical analysis. Note, that entering anything other than integer will produce an error, while inputting integer larger than 5 digits is likely to cause runtime error due to the time it takes to perform all the neccessary calculations on a such large number.

Example of program output for number 13:

* 13 is an <b>odd number</b>: 13 = 2&#215;6 &#43; 1.
* 13 is a <b>prime number</b>. Its only divisors are 1 and 13.
* From its <b>primality</b> the following qualities are guaranteed:
  * It is not <b>a powerful number</b>, which further implies the following qualities:
    * It is <b>not a perfect power</b>.
    * It is <b>a square-free number</b>.
  * Sub Item B
  * It is not <b>a semiprime number</b>.
  * It is not <b>a sphenic number</b>.
  * It is not <b>a pronic number</b>.
  * Its roughness and smoothness are equal to each other and to the number 13 itself, hence it is also <b>an unsual number</b>, because its greatest divisor is greater than square root of 13.
  * Its sum of divisors is 13 &#43; 1 &#61; 14 &#60; 2&#215;13, hence it is <b>a deficient number</b>, which means it is <b>not perfect or abundant</b>.
  * It is <b>not unitary perfect number</b>.
  * It is <b>not a primorial</b>.
* The abundancy index of 13 equals to 14/13 &#61; 1.0769230769230769.
* The arithmetic mean of its divisors is whole number (14/2 &#61; 7), hence it is <b>an arithmetic number</b>, just like all prime numbers except 2.

<h2>The Purpose of this Application</h2>
The number theory has varying applications in computer science, cryptography and other STEM disciplines. Knowledge of the divisability-related properties of the large integers is especially useful in the cryptography, where many cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA, depend on tge use of prime numbers for key generation procedures.

While primality has direct practical application, the other qualities such the sum of divisors, have more abstract value as tools of reasearch of various mathematical theories. For example, density of the abundant numbers is related to the famous Riemann Hypothesis. The other qualities relate to each other, for example, if number is semiprime, it can't be prime, which implies that research into semiprimes can pin down some of the qualities of the primes.
